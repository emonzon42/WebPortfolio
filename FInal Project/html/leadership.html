                        <p> 
                            This is my first official business with a website and everything. 
                            I handle everything from creating targeted ads, fulfilling customer's orders, and customer support.
                            I work with a third-party to supply the actual inventory that gets displayed on the website. 
                            The store is available on multiple fronts such as Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and Pinterest to name a few.
                            The main store front is powered by Shopify.
                            Our primary demographic is 15-35 year olds who (or want to) keep up with current urban fashions. 
                            We sell all kinds of street-style clothing for men and women alike.
                        </p>

                            <li>Create and present budgets, accounts and financial statements to the management committee</li>
                            <li>Collaborate with other executives on designing and implementing fundraising programs </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> 
                            As my first elected executive position in an organization, I did everything in my power to keep the clock running smoothly.
                            I handled collecting dues from members, organizing fundraisers (Treasurer also means being the chair of the fundraising committee), preparing tax documents, and various other financial duties.
                            
                        </p>

                            <li>Manage and maintain the organization’s online presence through various social media platforms</li>
                            <li>Coordinate and oversee weekly social events while maintaining a high standard of attendance</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p> 
                            Prior to being elected as Treasurer, I was elected as the chairman of both the Online and Social Committees.
                            I was in charge of creating various social media posts and campaigns to promote the organization's branding and events we hosted.
                            As the Social Committee Chair I worked with my co-chair to create entertaining social events for members and non-members alike.

                            During my freshman year of College, I was a part of a program called Living-Learning Community. I essentially was placed in housing
                            with others with similar interests as me, in this case it was a Engineering community so I could live with other Comp-Sci majors.
                            I would from time to time host study sessions with the other members to practice for our class. 
                            I had taken a Computer Science course at a different college during highschool before actually going to UAlbany so I had prior experience and exposure
                            to the topics we were learning in our intro classes.
                            So naturally I'd help others who were struggling with the material.
