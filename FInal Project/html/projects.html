                        <h2>LocaNotes!</h2>
                        
                        This project was created for my Software Engineering class in college. In this class we had to break into teams and build an application to solve a problem.
                        I already had an idea in my head for what I wanted to make: a location-based note-taking app for iOS using the Swift progamming language. 
                        After presenting the idea to my team and getting unanimous consent we got to work.
                        So lets you want to make a grocery list: you would create a note and write the list down like you would normally do in any other notes app. 
                        Then, you can set the location of the note on a interactive map to your supermarket. 
                        After, once you actually are at the supermarket it would essentially "pin" the note (and any other nearby created notes) at the top of the list so that it is easier to access.
                        You would also get a notification reminding you about your grocery list.
                        I didn't know the Swift language before this project so learning how to use it along with Apple's XCode was a challenge for sure.

                        <h2>MineSweeper</h2>
                        
                        This was one of the school projects I actually enjoyed completing. I recreated the classic puzzle game of Minesweeper using the C programming language.
                        A part I found particularly difficult at the time was when I had to create a recursive algorithm that reveals game tiles depending on whether a bomb is present or not.
                        So naturally I am proud of the end result. Even the professor was impressed with how creative my solutions and overall game design had been compared to my peers.
